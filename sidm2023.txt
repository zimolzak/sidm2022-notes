# Keynote

CNN program.[^cnn] Harry Hoar, from Baystate. Jake Tapper and Alice
Paul Tapper. In 2021. Outpatient peds phone call, local ER, transfer
to children's hospital. Xfer with dx gastro; outpatient doc suggested
consider appy. Speed bumps. Jump test. Can't straighten legs. 32 hours
later, imaging. Can't do OR, ICU, 2 drains. Outpatient, more fluid.
Initially attrib to post-lap pneumoperitoneum. PICC for nutrition.

[^cnn]: Opinion: I almost died last year from a.... Alice Tapper. CNN.
2022-12-15.

"Shitsgiving," Thanksgiving 2021. Know somebody who knows somebody.
Eventually, March 2022 appy at CHOP, 2 hr procedure. Was 90 pounds, 5
foot 10. BM complications. "Being dismissed." Code of silence,
analogous to thin blue line.

Q and A. What was the bias? A: all over abd pain means no appy, and
the jump test. Humility. Bias re: young women. Prashant Mahajan.

Cognitive or system or policy or cultural or what? Why wouldn't you
get imaging, why wouldn't you get a consult? Get more eyes on your
case. Open minds.

Mental health? A: Going back to school was hard. They visited but were
scared. EMDR therapy. Too weak; people didn't want to be around me.
Rowing crew.

Were residents or trainees involved? A: yes, seemed like following
orders. Important for voice; many eyes looking at case. Privates
listening to Colonel Kurtz. Did not seem collaborative.

Pediatrician POV, hindsight. Jump test is "if it hurts." A: We've
talked to the hospital. We did come in saying "we need to check for,"
and pediatrician did say check.

Disconnect between medical record and the patient.
