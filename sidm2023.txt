# Keynote

CNN program.[^cnn] Harry Hoar, from Baystate. Jake Tapper and Alice
Paul Tapper. In 2021. Outpatient peds phone call, local ER, transfer
to children's hospital. Xfer with dx gastro; outpatient doc suggested
consider appy. Speed bumps. Jump test. Can't straighten legs. 32 hours
later, imaging. Can't do OR, ICU, 2 drains. Outpatient, more fluid.
Initially attrib to post-lap pneumoperitoneum. PICC for nutrition.

[^cnn]: Opinion: I almost died last year from a.... Alice Tapper. CNN.
2022-12-15.

"Shitsgiving," Thanksgiving 2021. Know somebody who knows somebody.
Eventually, March 2022 appy at CHOP, 2 hr procedure. Was 90 pounds, 5
foot 10. BM complications. "Being dismissed." Code of silence,
analogous to thin blue line.

Q and A. What was the bias? A: all over abd pain means no appy, and
the jump test. Humility. Bias re: young women. Prashant Mahajan.

Cognitive or system or policy or cultural or what? Why wouldn't you
get imaging, why wouldn't you get a consult? Get more eyes on your
case. Open minds.

Mental health? A: Going back to school was hard. They visited but were
scared. EMDR therapy. Too weak; people didn't want to be around me.
Rowing crew.

Were residents or trainees involved? A: yes, seemed like following
orders. Important for voice; many eyes looking at case. Privates
listening to Colonel Kurtz. Did not seem collaborative.

Pediatrician POV, hindsight. Jump test is "if it hurts." A: We've
talked to the hospital. We did come in saying "we need to check for,"
and pediatrician did say check.

Disconnect between medical record and the patient.

# Uncertainties and Cognitive Psychology

Concurrent 1, 2:15 p.m.

- Introduction to Diagnostic Excellence (Graber, Schiff, Astik). Hope A.

- Disparities in Diagnosis and Treatment (Wang). Hope C.

- Complexities and Uncertainties in Diagnosis from a Cognitive
Psychology Lens (Zwaan, Olson, Sloane). Center Street B.

## Intro

A few Slido polls.

Jot down notes. Uncertainty. What was known and what was uncertain?
How did different people experience it differently. How was uncertainty
discussed?

> When to do the test? What was uncertain turned out to be some
> symptoms too. Uncertain: cost benefit. Hard to discuss. Goals in
> tension. Patient and family experiences. Not discussed much. If you
> choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

## Zwaan

Three types:

1. decision under *certainty,* you know what you get (soft drink).
2. under *risk,* you know probabilities (roulette).
3. under *uncertainty,* you *don't* know the probabilities.

Maybe you don't even know all the options. Try to reduce
uncertainty[^unc]. Disease evolution happens. Healthy, change (but not
disease), presymptom dz, and symptom dz (but can be weird
presentation). Excessive test among the first 2 (healthy or just a
change) result in overdiagnosis.

[^unc]: Zwaan BMJQS 2019

Often, juniors are less tolerant of uncertainty than
experts[^jr][^adv].

[^jr]: Lawton, BMJQS

[^adv]: adv in health sci edu 2018

## Case role play

(See separately.)

- Ask clarifying question(s) about, "Is he going to be OK?"
- Do say "I don't know"
- Do tell truth, even if hard

> Hard to ask hard question. Waiting for answer.

Epistemic versus aleatoric uncertainty. I need more information,
versus empathy.

## Diagnostic Process

Jenny Sloane. Domains of cognition: mem, attn, percep, metacogn,
think and problem solve, language. Memory: 12k or 63k diseases is
hard. Attention and percep: did you miss something? Meta: is you
accuracy aligned with confidence? Often the answer is no (under- or
overcofident). Thinking and prob: is your thinking biased? Can we
de-bias? Be aware there are biases. Languaage: often not discussed as
a domain. Are we communicating effectively?

Meta: Physicians don't always know what they don't know.

Feedback is a solution. Physician $\to$ decision process $\to$
outcome, which can be a good one or not. If not, re-calibrate and go
back to the doc[^pc]. Favorable is not highlighted enough, probably.
Feedback here allows you to *maintain* your calibration. But then,
outcome sometimes unknown.

[^pc]: Croskerry

How does uncertainty occur thru dx process[^exper]. Five steps.
Engaage, info gather, interp, working dx, communicate dx.

[^exper]: Meyer ANDM. Patient and clinician experiences of
uncertainty. *Patient Education and Counseling.*

Ask people what they searched, not what they read.

# TUESDAY

# Plenary: Clinical Reasoning Assessment

Michael Barone, MD, MPH (vp compentency based assessment, peds, JHU).
Christopher Runyon, PhD.

Reviews: curric not always good at teaching reasoning[^hmk][^kz].
USMLE Step 2 CS stopped during pandemic. Then decided no relaunch. It
was driving resources to standardized patients in schools.

[^hmk]: Hawks MK. Clinical Reasoning Curricula. Acad Med 2023.

[^kz]: Kanjee, Zahir. Teaching Evidence-Based Physical. MedEdPortal.

Summative:
: assessment *of* learning. Like "how did you do on the whole course."

Formative:
: assessment *for* learning. See if knowledge gaps and room for
improvement.

Start with the inference yyou want to make about learner (in some kind
of phrase like "learner understands $x$").

Clinical reasoning:
: a skill, process, or outcome wherein clinicians observe, collect, and
interpret data do dx/tx patient[^def]

[^def]: Daniel M, Rencic J, Durning SJ, *et al.* Clinical Reasoning
Assessment Methods: A Scoping Review and Practical Guidance. *Acad
Med.* 2019;94(6):902--912.

There are 7 components[^def]. Outcome is the outcome: right or wrong,
but don't know if right because know, or by guessing. Process is: what
was their thinking? They can highlight 5 pieces of info that best
support plantar fasciitis.

Funded 10 faculty to partner. OSCE. "Creator community," $n \approx
11$ faculty from schools. To create patients or assessments. Learners
are involved too. Build validity on the way. Not "build first, then
see afterwards whether it measures what we think/want." Now trying to
get info gather, hypothesis gener, etc. {Be curious, organize your
questions, avoid irrelevant hx questions} $\in$ use hypothesis to
gather hx. Plus, you can do things like concise $\times$ organized,
and $\times$ organ system, too.

Comp linguistics. He says NLP $\subset$ CompLing. Example: *Julius
Caesar,* count all instances of one word, count proper nouns, count
2-grams, count skip-grams. Student will write a note; turn it into
clinical concepts (account for lexical variants).

Fairness and equity. Make sure items don't perpetuate bias. And
*differential item function analysis*.

- outcome $\land$ summative is predominant
- CompLing for measuring more complex things
- $\exists$ fairness and equitiy concerns
- $\exists$ AI competencies too

## Q and A

De-skilling due to AI? A: Think of Internet advent. Hold on less dear
to thinkgs we thought were dear. Co-production.




# Concurrent: Recognizing excellence in dx, hospital settings

Mark Graber. Jean-Luc Tilly, Leapfrog. Alex Campione. Matt Austin,
PhD, from JHU.

Survey of 95 hospitals. Why hospitals? Why not measure plan level,
provider level, *etc.*? Kind of includes ER. 250k dx error / yr
inpatient.

> Supposedly 900k beds (statista.com, aha.org). So 0.278 / bed / yr.
> Couple hundred bed hospital: 56 / yr. One every 6.6 days. That
> actually seems low.

Sue Sheridan, Patients for Patient Safety. PCAST, 6 member working grp
on pt safety, early 2022. Can make recs to HHS agencies. There is a
report[^pcast].

[^pcast]: Report to the President: A Transformational Effort on
Patient Safety. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology. September 2023. whitehouse.gov/ wp-content/ uploads/
2023/09/ PCAST_Patient-Safety-Report_Sept2023.pdf

"There are a lot of quality measures." Debate on burden, cost/benefit.
Leapfrog has seen it work in maternity care. Early elective deliveries
< 5%, worked from 2010--2014 (was 17%). Episiotomy, 5%, worked
almost, from 2015--2020, was 10% at start. Takes a while to get there
once measure is introduced, and keeps some sustained decrease after
hitting target. There is their report[^leap]. MeasureDx and SaferDx
Checklist. Divvy at Geisinger too. They use 2021 AHRQ *Common Formats
for Event Reporting - Diagnostic Error*. Does have to be communicated
to patient *effectively*. So, one result in patient portal is not
necessarily effective.

[^leap]: leapfroggroup.org/ influencing/ recognizing-excellence-diagnosis

There are some patient-focused recommended practices. Have working
PFAC. Give patient tools[^tool]. Clinician-focused: get 2nd dopinions,
protected time, discrepant rad or path finding, take responsibility
that results and TPAD are viewed and communicated to patient timely
(close the loop). Leadership-focused.

[^tool]: AHRQ Toolkit for Engaging.... SIDM Patient Toolkit for
Diagnosis.

## Pilot Survey

Alex Campione. So that was $\frac{14}{29}$ practices covered in that
overview of Leapfrog report. We surveyed $N = 95$ hospitals
perticipated. Big majority urban, majority teaching. 48% were
achieving Leapfrog 'A' grade, which is high. Common in PA, CA, FL, KY,
NY, CT. About 5 hosps were superstars, implemented $> \frac{1}{2}$ of
the 16 Domain 1 practices. Sometimes there was misunderstanding of the
practice. They say "achieved" when really not meeting all points. The
norm is "done or working on $> \frac{1}{2}$." Of patient-focused: most
implemented is notify pts of dx errors, and least is help patients by
using toolkits. Clinician: most is discrepant, least is close loop.
Leadership: the category with biggest lack of implementation.
Controversial one was CEO commitment via statement, and also least
implemented (only 13%).




# PRO for timely cancer dx (other concurrent)

**Claire O'Hanlon**, Rebecca Anhang Price, *et al*. RAND Corporation.

Survey to understand system brakdowns in dx process. GBMF funding. How
did we come up with these Qs, and our panel process, technical expert
clinical user patient panel (TECUPP, pronounced *teacup*).

Look at every survey about timely cancer dx. $N = 14$ on TECUPP. 4
research experts, 3 clinical (pcp, onc, er), 7 patients. $M = 6 \times
90$ min meetings in early 2023, anchor by a pt dx story. Followed a
model[^bmod]. Important, can report on, and docs can act on: $I \cap R
\cap A$. Cross off the HPI and exam: hard for pts to report on (tell
whether approp).

[^bmod]: Bell SK et al. Filling a gap in safety metrics. BMJQS 2022.

- 28 substantive
- 9 demographic
- 2 open-ended

Did cogn testing with unfamiliar ppl, $K = 15$. It's a "pan-cancer"
measure. Alpha test in $P = 1176$ Cedars Sinai patients. Domains are:
type and stage, route (sx, screen, incidental), usu care and barriers,
specialist and barriers, tests, access to interpreters, overall
experience.

Denominator:
: All stage I--IV ICD-10 codes, except common skin CA C44 and CA-like
C96, $\land$ new dx in last 6 mo $\pm$ 3 mo, look back a certain number of
years.

Publicly available and free to use!

Q and A. A: Delay conflates several different concepts.

My Q, can you do other than ICD? A: Registry might not be OK, if not
up to date. But depends on your site's backlog. Also attrition. Also
we don't exclude based on hospice or palliative.

## Handoff of PICU

Tina Cifra.

Especially urgent inter-facility. Many have dx discordance[^disc].
Focused ethnography. Direct observation of first "tuck in," waiver of
consent and ask after the fact. Recorded the routinely recorded phone
communication. Coding and thematic analysis. New model of the dx
process handoff. $N = 19$ patients, with their parents/guardians, 206
person hours of observation, 80 interviews. Themes:

- referring hosp does not have $x$ resource
- there is "PICU team" and "rest of the PICU team."
- they get more info fr parents, and parents need time
- there are relationship factors betw referring and PICU

Done at U Iowa, AHRQ K08.

## Signaling Sepsis Clinical Decision Support

Kristen Miller, MedStar Health, National Center for Human Factors in
Healthcare.

Reluctance to use the word *sepsis.* "Just say sepsis" campaign. Were
interested in "pyro" sepsis scoring system. Usability and
acceptability endpoint too. Some don't present with sepsis but develop
it. Opportunities: "sepsis APP"; also not enough rapid responses.

Current HIT tools. They have to hunt and gather. What did they want:
patient info, CMS bundle done/not, Did: dashboard, nurse driven.
Patient level "MPage," where we put the stuff they wanted to see into
a single page. Limited by working within Cerner. Had a UI/UX person
evaluate, and IT was able to make some changes.

Evaluation: 300 uses in 3 months. Mortality index seemed to go down.
Usability scores reasonable. Experienced people thought it was more
usable.

> Without significant funding, we cannot build complex health IT tools
> into the EHR.

Niche was **nurses**. SIDM DxQI project.

# Plenary: Funder’s Perspective

## AHRQ

Craig Umscheid, Margie Shofer, from Ctr for Qual Improvement and Pt
Safety, AHRQ. **CQuIPS.**

Consider: NIH, AHRQ, FDA, CDC, which are some of HHS. ${N, A, F, C} \in H$

ahrq : qual :: cdc : pub health :: nih : biomed

Starting in 2019, dedicated funds for Dx safety, not just from
general. Split betw grants and contracts. Ten DCEs, dx safety ctrs of
excellence. A *pt safety learning lab* uses sys engineering approach.
Several program announcements. K08, K01, R03, R01, R18, R13. New ones:
R01 dx safe in *ambulatory* which includes ED, by the way. R18, also
ambulatory (Feb). Get it in early!

Whole lot of issue briefs $(n = 15)$. Medstar, with sub to BCM.
Published too, we paid open acc.

Practice improvement. You can use these tools *today!* Several
patient-facing, including "Be the expert on you." For providers, "60
seconds to improve dx safety." Measure Dx. Calibrate Dx. TeamSTEPPS.

Evaluate those resources! Email Margie if interested.

Craig, on data and measurement portfolio.

PSO:
: an org that interacts with a provider org to collect, digest, etc.,
to improve patient safety. Often feedback. Provider org gets legal
protections.

AHRQ certifies and lists PSOs. Also common formats. So that **the
country knows what patient safety events are occurring**. Survey on
Patient Safety Culture (SOPS). There is a dx safety supplemental item
set. $\exists$ a DB, makes for deident data sharing for research. $N =
1126$ respondents from 110 offices (2020--2021).

Sec of HHS, patient safety call to action. IHI's *Safer Together*. Nat
action alliance to advance patient safety: launch winter 2023. There
have been webinars.
