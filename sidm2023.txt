# Keynote

CNN program.[^cnn] Harry Hoar, from Baystate. Jake Tapper and Alice
Paul Tapper. In 2021. Outpatient peds phone call, local ER, transfer
to children's hospital. Xfer with dx gastro; outpatient doc suggested
consider appy. Speed bumps. Jump test. Can't straighten legs. 32 hours
later, imaging. Can't do OR, ICU, 2 drains. Outpatient, more fluid.
Initially attrib to post-lap pneumoperitoneum. PICC for nutrition.

[^cnn]: Opinion: I almost died last year from a.... Alice Tapper. CNN.
2022-12-15.

"Shitsgiving," Thanksgiving 2021. Know somebody who knows somebody.
Eventually, March 2022 appy at CHOP, 2 hr procedure. Was 90 pounds, 5
foot 10. BM complications. "Being dismissed." Code of silence,
analogous to thin blue line.

Q and A. What was the bias? A: all over abd pain means no appy, and
the jump test. Humility. Bias re: young women. Prashant Mahajan.

Cognitive or system or policy or cultural or what? Why wouldn't you
get imaging, why wouldn't you get a consult? Get more eyes on your
case. Open minds.

Mental health? A: Going back to school was hard. They visited but were
scared. EMDR therapy. Too weak; people didn't want to be around me.
Rowing crew.

Were residents or trainees involved? A: yes, seemed like following
orders. Important for voice; many eyes looking at case. Privates
listening to Colonel Kurtz. Did not seem collaborative.

Pediatrician POV, hindsight. Jump test is "if it hurts." A: We've
talked to the hospital. We did come in saying "we need to check for,"
and pediatrician did say check.

Disconnect between medical record and the patient.




# Patient summit

Kathryn McDonald, PhD, MM, BS. Viewed as passive puzzle[^grae] and
doctor is puzzle master. The patient is in, and MIS-C[^olog]. Patient
repoted measures[^bell][^zw1]. They all cite "The patient is in." Why
the training? Why training to be heard? Why training to be patient
advocates? Inequity[^gay].

[^gay]: Wiegand AA et al., and McDonald. It's probably an STI because
you're gay: a qualitative study.

[^zw1]: Zwaan, et al., and Singh. Patient generated research
priorities. *Patient Education and Counseling.*

Patient perceptions of endometriosis misdiagnosis

[^bell]: Bell SK, Bourgeois. Patient identification of diagnostic. *Milbank Q*.

# Uncertainties and Cognitive Psychology

Concurrent 1, 2:15 p.m.

- Introduction to Diagnostic Excellence (Graber, Schiff, Astik). Hope A.

- Disparities in Diagnosis and Treatment (Wang). Hope C.

- Complexities and Uncertainties in Diagnosis from a Cognitive
Psychology Lens (Zwaan, Olson, Sloane). Center Street B.

## Intro

A few Slido polls.

Jot down notes. Uncertainty. What was known and what was uncertain?
How did different peole experience it differently. How was uncertainty
discussed?

> When to do the test? What was uncertain turned out to be some
> symptoms too. Uncertain: cost benefit. Hard to discuss. Goals in
> tension. Patient and family experiences. Not discussed much. If you
> choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

## Zwaan

Three types:

1. decision under *certainty,* you know what you get (soft drink).
2. under *risk,* you know probabilities (roulette).
3. under *uncertaianty,* you *don't* know the probabilities.

Maybe you don't even know all the options. Try to reduce
uncertainty[^unc]. Disease evolution happens. Healthy, change (but not
disease), presymptom dz, and symptom dz (but can be weird
presentation). Excessive test among the first 2 (healthy or just a
change) result in overdiagnosis.

[^unc]: Zwaan BMJQS 2019

Often, juniors aare less toleraant of uncertaaainty thana
experts[^jr][^adv].

[^jr]: Lawton, BMJQS

[^aadv]: adv in heaalth sci edu 2018

## Case role play

(See separately.)

- Ask clarifying question(s) about, "Is he going to be OK?"
- Do say "I don't know"
- Do tell truth, even if hard

> Hard to ask hard question. Waiting for answer.

Epistemic versus aleatoric uncertainty. I need more information,
versus empathy.

## Diagnostic Process

Jenny Sloane. Domaains of cognition: mem, attn, percep, metacogn,
think and problem solve, language. Memory: 12k or 63k diseases is
hard. Attention oand percep: did you miss something? Meta: is you
accuracy aligned with confidence? Often the answer is no (under- or
overcofident). Thinking and prob: is your thinking biased? Can we
de-bias? Be aware there are biases. Languaage: often not discussed as
a domain. Are we communicating effectively?

Meta: Physicians don't always know what they don't know.

Feedback is a solution. Physician $\to$ decision process $\to$
outcome, which can be a good one or not. If not, re-calibrate and go
back to the doc[^pc]. Favorable is not highlighted enough, probably.
Feedback here allows you to *maintain* your calibration. But then,
outcome sometimes unknown.

[^pc]: Croskerry

How does uncertainty occur thru dx process[^exper]. Five steps.
Engaage, info gather, interp, working dx, communicate dx.

[^exper]: Meyer ANDM. Patient and clinician experiences of
uncertainty. *Patient Education and Counseling.*

Ask people what they searched, not what they read.
