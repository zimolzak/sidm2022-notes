# Keynote

CNN program.[^cnn] Harry Hoar, from Baystate. Jake Tapper and Alice
Paul Tapper. In 2021. Outpatient peds phone call, local ER, transfer
to children's hospital. Xfer with dx gastro; outpatient doc suggested
consider appy. Speed bumps. Jump test. Can't straighten legs. 32 hours
later, imaging. Can't do OR, ICU, 2 drains. Outpatient, more fluid.
Initially attrib to post-lap pneumoperitoneum. PICC for nutrition.

[^cnn]: Opinion: I almost died last year from a.... Alice Tapper. CNN.
2022-12-15.

"Shitsgiving," Thanksgiving 2021. Know somebody who knows somebody.
Eventually, March 2022 appy at CHOP, 2 hr procedure. Was 90 pounds, 5
foot 10. BM complications. "Being dismissed." Code of silence,
analogous to thin blue line.

Q and A. What was the bias? A: all over abd pain means no appy, and
the jump test. Humility. Bias re: young women. Prashant Mahajan.

Cognitive or system or policy or cultural or what? Why wouldn't you
get imaging, why wouldn't you get a consult? Get more eyes on your
case. Open minds.

Mental health? A: Going back to school was hard. They visited but were
scared. EMDR therapy. Too weak; people didn't want to be around me.
Rowing crew.

Were residents or trainees involved? A: yes, seemed like following
orders. Important for voice; many eyes looking at case. Privates
listening to Colonel Kurtz. Did not seem collaborative.

Pediatrician POV, hindsight. Jump test is "if it hurts." A: We've
talked to the hospital. We did come in saying "we need to check for,"
and pediatrician did say check.

Disconnect between medical record and the patient.

# Uncertainties and Cognitive Psychology

Concurrent 1, 2:15 p.m.

- Introduction to Diagnostic Excellence (Graber, Schiff, Astik). Hope A.

- Disparities in Diagnosis and Treatment (Wang). Hope C.

- Complexities and Uncertainties in Diagnosis from a Cognitive
Psychology Lens (Zwaan, Olson, Sloane). Center Street B.

## Intro

A few Slido polls.

Jot down notes. Uncertainty. What was known and what was uncertain?
How did different people experience it differently. How was uncertainty
discussed?

> When to do the test? What was uncertain turned out to be some
> symptoms too. Uncertain: cost benefit. Hard to discuss. Goals in
> tension. Patient and family experiences. Not discussed much. If you
> choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.

## Zwaan

Three types:

1. decision under *certainty,* you know what you get (soft drink).
2. under *risk,* you know probabilities (roulette).
3. under *uncertainty,* you *don't* know the probabilities.

Maybe you don't even know all the options. Try to reduce
uncertainty[^unc]. Disease evolution happens. Healthy, change (but not
disease), presymptom dz, and symptom dz (but can be weird
presentation). Excessive test among the first 2 (healthy or just a
change) result in overdiagnosis.

[^unc]: Zwaan BMJQS 2019

Often, juniors are less tolerant of uncertainty than
experts[^jr][^adv].

[^jr]: Lawton, BMJQS

[^adv]: adv in health sci edu 2018

## Case role play

(See separately.)

- Ask clarifying question(s) about, "Is he going to be OK?"
- Do say "I don't know"
- Do tell truth, even if hard

> Hard to ask hard question. Waiting for answer.

Epistemic versus aleatoric uncertainty. I need more information,
versus empathy.

## Diagnostic Process

Jenny Sloane. Domains of cognition: mem, attn, percep, metacogn,
think and problem solve, language. Memory: 12k or 63k diseases is
hard. Attention and percep: did you miss something? Meta: is you
accuracy aligned with confidence? Often the answer is no (under- or
overcofident). Thinking and prob: is your thinking biased? Can we
de-bias? Be aware there are biases. Languaage: often not discussed as
a domain. Are we communicating effectively?

Meta: Physicians don't always know what they don't know.

Feedback is a solution. Physician $\to$ decision process $\to$
outcome, which can be a good one or not. If not, re-calibrate and go
back to the doc[^pc]. Favorable is not highlighted enough, probably.
Feedback here allows you to *maintain* your calibration. But then,
outcome sometimes unknown.

[^pc]: Croskerry

How does uncertainty occur thru dx process[^exper]. Five steps.
Engaage, info gather, interp, working dx, communicate dx.

[^exper]: Meyer ANDM. Patient and clinician experiences of
uncertainty. *Patient Education and Counseling.*

Ask people what they searched, not what they read.

# Plenary: Clinical Reasoning Assessment

Michael Barone, MD, MPH (vp compentency based assessment, peds, JHU).
Christopher Runyon, PhD.

Reviews: curric not always good at teaching reasoning[^hmk][^kz].
USMLE Step 2 CS stopped during pandemic. Then decided no relaunch. It
was driving resources to standardized patients in schools.

[^hmk]: Hawks MK. Clinical Reasoning Curricula. Acad Med 2023.

[^kz]: Kanjee, Zahir. Teaching Evidence-Based Physical. MedEdPortal.

Summative:
: assessment *of* learning. Like "how did you do on the whole course."

Formative:
: assessment *for* learning. See if knowledge gaps and room for
improvement.

Start with the inference yyou want to make about learner (in some kind
of phrase like "learner understands $x$").

Clinical reasoning:
: a skill, process, or outcome wherein clinicians observe, collect, and
interpret data do dx/tx patient[^def]

[^def]: Daniel M, Rencic J, Durning SJ, *et al.* Clinical Reasoning
Assessment Methods: A Scoping Review and Practical Guidance. *Acad
Med.* 2019;94(6):902--912.

There are 7 components[^def]. Outcome is the outcome: right or wrong,
but don't know if right because know, or by guessing. Process is: what
was their thinking? They can highlight 5 pieces of info that best
support plantar fasciitis.

Funded 10 faculty to partner. OSCE. "Creator community," $n \approx
11$ faculty from schools. To create patients or assessments. Learners
are involved too. Build validity on the way. Not "build first, then
see afterwards whether it measures what we think/want." Now trying to
get info gather, hypothesis gener, etc. {Be curious, organize your
questions, avoid irrelevant hx questions} $\in$ use hypothesis to
gather hx. Plus, you can do things like concise $\times$ organized,
and $\times$ organ system, too.

Comp linguistics. He says NLP $\subset$ CompLing. Example: *Julius
Caesar,* count all instances of one word, count proper nouns, count
2-grams, count skip-grams. Student will write a note; turn it into
clinical concepts (account for lexical variants).

Fairness and equity. Make sure items don't perpetuate bias. And
*differential item function analysis*.

- outcome $\land$ summative is predominant
- CompLing for measuring more complex things
- $\exists$ fairness and equitiy concerns
- $\exists$ AI competencies too

## Q and A

De-skilling due to AI? A: Think of Internet advent. Hold on less dear
to thinkgs we thought were dear. Co-production.




# Concurrent: Recognizing excellence in dx, hospital settings

Mark Graber. Jean-Luc Tilly, Leapfrog. Alex Campione. Matt Austin,
PhD, from JHU.

Survey of 95 hospitals. Why hospitals? Why not measure plan level,
provider level, *etc.*? Kind of includes ER. 250k dx error / yr
inpatient.

> Supposedly 900k beds (statista.com, aha.org). So 0.278 / bed / yr.
> Couple hundred bed hospital: 56 / yr. One every 6.6 days. That
> actually seems low.

Sue Sheridan, Patients for Patient Safety. PCAST, 6 member working grp
on pt safety, early 2022. Can make recs to HHS agencies. There is a
report[^pcast].

[^pcast]: Report to the President: A Transformational Effort on
Patient Safety. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology. September 2023. whitehouse.gov/ wp-content/ uploads/
2023/09/ PCAST_Patient-Safety-Report_Sept2023.pdf

"There are a lot of quality measures." Debate on burden, cost/benefit.
Leapfrog has seen it work in maternity care. Early elective deliveries
< 5%, worked from 2010--2014 (was 17%). Episiotomy, 5%, worked
almost, from 2015--2020, was 10% at start. Takes a while to get there
once measure is introduced, and keeps some sustained decrease after
hitting target. There is their report[^leap]. MeasureDx and SaferDx
Checklist. Divvy at Geisinger too. They use 2021 AHRQ *Common Formats
for Event Reporting - Diagnostic Error*. Does have to be communicated
to patient *effectively*. So, one result in patient portal is not
necessarily effective.

[^leap]: leapfroggroup.org/ influencing/ recognizing-excellence-diagnosis

There are some patient-focused recommended practices. Have working
PFAC. Give patient tools[^tool]. Clinician-focused: get 2nd dopinions,
protected time, discrepant rad or path finding, take responsibility
that results and TPAD are viewed and communicated to patient timely
(close the loop). Leadership-focused.

[^tool]: AHRQ Toolkit for Engaging.... SIDM Patient Toolkit for
Diagnosis.

## Pilot Survey

Alex Campione. So that was $\frac{14}{29}$ practices covered in that
overview of Leapfrog report. We surveyed $N = 95$ hospitals
perticipated. Big majority urban, majority teaching. 48% were
achieving Leapfrog 'A' grade, which is high. Common in PA, CA, FL, KY,
NY, CT. About 5 hosps were superstars, implemented $> \frac{1}{2}$ of
the 16 Domain 1 practices. Sometimes there was misunderstanding of the
practice. They say "achieved" when really not meeting all points. The
norm is "done or working on $> \frac{1}{2}$." Of patient-focused: most
implemented is notify pts of dx errors, and least is help patients by
using toolkits. Clinician: most is discrepant, least is close loop.
Leadership: the category with biggest lack of implementation.
Controversial one was CEO commitment via statement, and also least
implemented (only 13%).
