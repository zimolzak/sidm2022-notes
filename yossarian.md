# My aside

Previously in our scene, "The wound Yossarian saw was in the outside
of Snowden's thigh, as large and deep as a football, it seemed."

> But first he hastily drew a tourniquet around Snowden's
> thigh because he could not think what else to do in those first
> tumultuous moments when his senses were in turmoil, when he knew he
> must act competently at once and feared he might go to pieces
> completely. Snowden watched him steadily, saying nothing. No artery
> was spurting, but Yossarian pretended to absorb himself entirely into
> the fashioning of a tourniquet, because applying a tourniquet was
> something he did know how to do. He worked with simulated skill and

Yossarian spends quite a while saying "There, there," while Snowden
says, "I'm cold." He spends a few paragraphs and 1000 words taking
care of the leg wound.

> Snowden shook his head feebly. "I'm cold," he repeated, with eyes as
> dull and blind as stone. "I'm cold."

> "There, there," said Yossarian, with growing doubt and trepidation.
> "There, there. In a little while we'll be back on the ground and Doc
> Daneeka will take care of you."

> But Snowden kept shaking his head and pointed at last, with just the
> barest movement of his chin, down toward his armpit. Yossarian bent
> forward to peer and saw a strangely colored stain seeping through
> the coveralls just above the armhole of Snowden's flak suit.
> Yossarian felt his heart stop, then pound so violently he found it
> difficult to breathe. Snowden was wounded inside his flak suit.
> Yossarian ripped open the snaps of Snowden's flak suit and heard
> himself scream wildly as Snowden's insides slithered down to the

> more than three inches big had shot into his other side just
> underneath the arm and blasted all the way through, drawing whole
> mottled quarts of Snowden along with it through the gigantic hole in
