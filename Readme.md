## Overview

Thinking Fast and Slow. NASEM main framework. Gather, interpret,
working diagnosis, iterate if not sufficient info collected. *Cf.*
DEER Taxonomy with access, hx, exam, tests, assessment, referral,
follow-up.[^deer] Each stage has at least two ways that something can
go wrong.

[^deer]: Schiff. Diagnosing Diagnosis Errors.

Intuitive: pattern match. "This is obviously shingles." But miss
things if you latch on, or miss when the dx doesn't fit the pattern.
What's a trigger to dislodge you and go to system 2?

More of spectrum. "Intuitive" not quite right word.

"Recognition-primed decision making."
