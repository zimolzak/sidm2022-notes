## Overview

Thinking Fast and Slow. NASEM main framework. Gather, interpret,
working diagnosis, iterate if not sufficient info collected. *Cf.*
DEER Taxonomy with access, hx, exam, tests, assessment, referral,
follow-up.[^deer] Each stage has at least two ways that something can
go wrong.

[^deer]: Schiff. Diagnosing Diagnosis Errors.

Intuitive: pattern match. "This is obviously shingles." But miss
things if you latch on, or miss when the dx doesn't fit the pattern.
What's a trigger to dislodge you and go to system 2?

More of a spectrum (system 1 versus 2). "Intuitive" not quite right
word.

"Recognition-primed decision making." Play something forward: mental
simulation, would that work in this patient? Act or not[^klein]. If
there is a CDSS for shingles, hard not to just click through. Hard to
pay attention to second opinion. CDSS should be there when it's
helpful: but also do they recognize when it's helpful. Discrepancy
accuracy versus confidence: what if you don't realize you need it?

[^klein]: Gary Klein

Threshold model, test and treat. There is a threshold $T_{test}$ and
another one $T_{treat}$. See also threshold over time[^donn]. Some of
art is setting threshold[^pauk]. Tests can have risks; obviously
tretments do also. Those risks can affect thresholds. Lot of patient-
and provider-specific components that afffect thresholds, separate and
a part from what's in the EHR.

[^pauk]: Pauker, Kassirer. *NEJM.* 1980.

[^donn]: Donner-Banzhofff. *Ann Fam Med.* 2018.

Clinical decision support:
: Provides clinicians, staff, patient, others, with knowledge and
person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at
appropriate times, to enhance health and healthcare.
