## Overview

Thinking Fast and Slow. **NASEM** main framework. Gather, interpret,
working diagnosis, iterate if not sufficient info collected. *Cf.*
the **DEER Taxonomy** with access, hx, exam, tests, assessment, referral,
follow-up.[^deer] Each stage has at least two ways that something can
go wrong.

[^deer]: Schiff. Diagnosing Diagnosis Errors.

Intuitive: pattern match. "This is obviously shingles." But miss
things if you latch on, or miss when the dx doesn't fit the pattern.
What's a trigger to dislodge you and go to system 2?

More of a spectrum (system 1 versus 2). "Intuitive" not quite right
word.

**Recognition-primed decision making** framework. Play something
forward: mental simulation, would that work in this patient? Act or
not[^klein]. If there is a CDSS for shingles, hard not to just click
through. Hard to pay attention to second opinion. CDSS should be there
when it's helpful: but also do they recognize when it's helpful.
Discrepancy accuracy versus confidence: what if you don't realize you
need it?

[^klein]: Gary Klein

**Threshold model** is another (fourth?) framework, test and treat.
There is a threshold $T_{test}$ and another one $T_{treat}$. See also
threshold over time[^donn]. Some of art is setting threshold[^pauk].
Tests can have risks; obviously tretments do also. Those risks can
affect thresholds. Lot of patient- and provider-specific components
that afffect thresholds, separate and a part from what's in the EHR.

[^pauk]: Pauker, Kassirer. *NEJM.* 1980.

[^donn]: Donner-Banzhofff. *Ann Fam Med.* 2018.

Clinical decision support:
: Provides clinicians, staff, patient, others, with knowledge and
person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at
appropriate times, to enhance health and healthcare.

Better history-taking? Information gathering in the NASEM cycle.
Technology to support/prompt that. CDSS targets in the second
"recognition" framework: how close is this case to previous, will it
*really* work, etc. Conventional clinical, versus CDSS, versus
integrative[^yu]. And finally fully automated.

[^yu]: Yu KH et al. Nat Biomet Eng. 2018;2:719.




## Group

Three groups of four. Clinician.

1. What parts of dx process?
2. Why might dx opportunity occur?
3. Could it happen, why or why not?

Case: sys hf, leg swell, aki, dyspn, pcp increase diuretic, but worse,
admitted. Exam = VS "stable", rales, maybe hi JVP. Hi creat and BNP,
CXR is pulm edema. Working dx: ADHF. Tx: more diuretic.

(Are the hands that big a thing? Reframe vs spectrum. What if not
noticed urine? What evidence for HF? Dramatic: for whom do you check?
Not even a CPC?)

- History: magnitude, extent, hands.
- Labs: creat, was it new? albumin was a chance.

*Situated cognition.*

# My aside

Previously in our scene, "The wound Yossarian saw was in the outside
of Snowden's thigh, as large and deep as a football, it seemed."

> But first he hastily drew a tourniquet around Snowden's
> thigh because he could not think what else to do in those first
> tumultuous moments when his senses were in turmoil, when he knew he
> must act competently at once and feared he might go to pieces
> completely. Snowden watched him steadily, saying nothing. No artery
> was spurting, but Yossarian pretended to absorb himself entirely into
> the fashioning of a tourniquet, because applying a tourniquet was
> something he did know how to do. He worked with simulated skill and
> composure, feeling Snowden's lack-luster gaze resting upon him.

Yossarian spends quite a while saying "There, there," while Snowden
says, "I'm cold." He spends a few paragraphs and 1000 words taking
care of the leg wound.

> Snowden shook his head feebly. "I'm cold," he repeated, with eyes as
> dull and blind as stone. "I'm cold."

> "There, there," said Yossarian, with growing doubt and trepidation.
> "There, there. In a little while we'll be back on the ground and Doc
> Daneeka will take care of you."

> But Snowden kept shaking his head and pointed at last, with just the
> barest movement of his chin, down toward his armpit. Yossarian bent
> forward to peer and saw a strangely colored stain seeping through
> the coveralls just above the armhole of Snowden's flak suit.
> Yossarian felt his heart stop, then pound so violently he found it
> difficult to breathe. Snowden was wounded inside his flak suit.
> Yossarian ripped open the snaps of Snowden's flak suit and heard
> himself scream wildly as Snowden's insides slithered down to the
> floor in a soggy pile and just kept dripping out. A chunk of flak
> more than three inches big had shot into his other side just
> underneath the arm and blasted all the way through, drawing whole
> mottled quarts of Snowden along with it through the gigantic hole in
> his ribs it made as it blasted out. Yossarian screamed a second time
> and squeezed both hands over his eyes. His teeth were chattering in
> horror. He forced himself to look again.
